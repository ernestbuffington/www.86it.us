<h2>PHP-Nuke Titanium Dev 4 Security</h2>

<p>Security is the top priority for this CMS, the core of PHP-Nuke Titanium uses a comprehensive integrated module called Nuke Sentinel (tm). Nuke Sentinel (tm) protects your website against DDOS, CLIKE, Union, and many more attacks, Nuke Sentinel (tm) is so advanced you don&#39;t even have to worry about protecting your admin panel as it watches for failed logins and can ban anonymous users automatically from your website.</p>

<p>Hopefully, you will never have to visit the admin panel for Nuke Sentinel (tm) as 99% of all web hosts now have DDOS protection and many more security features which prevent attacks and such.</p>
